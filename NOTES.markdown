## Design
Hobo Std is pretty neat
Yeah, orientation should go between clock and timeline (with +/- just on timeline probably)
Possible games (post launch): piano, kaleidoscope (or video), matrix.
Sign language would be awesome.

## Assets
"Nervous matrix" type of touch based animation (with farm animals that make sounds)
Bubble wrap -like popping of bubbles, which activate an animation or sound



When game launches, it locks the app. If later waking up in home menu, without proper unlock, it would lock the creation ui.
